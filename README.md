### Introduction

The RAMM EVM SDK is a comprehensive toolkit that brings EVM compatibility to the Solana blockchain. It leverages Solana's high-performance infrastructure while providing developers with familiar Ethereum development tools and libraries.

### Features

- EVM Compatibility: Execute Ethereum smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.
- Solidity Support: Write smart contracts in Solidity, the popular Ethereum programming language.
- Web3.js Integration: Connect to the Solana network using Web3.js, enabling seamless interaction with smart contracts.
- Scalability: Utilize Solana's high throughput and low transaction fees for decentralized applications (DApps).

### Installation

To install the RAMM EVM SDK, follow these steps:

```
npm install @ramm/evm-sdk
```

### Getting Started

1. Initialize Solana Wallet:

```
const wallet = await solanaWeb3.createWallet();
```

2. Deploy EVM Contract:

```
const evmContract = await rammEvm.deployContract(wallet, "YourSolidityContract.sol");
```

3. Interact with Smart Contract:`

```
const result = await evmContract.methods.yourSmartContractMethod().send();
```

### Usage

The RAMM EVM SDK provides a set of APIs for interacting with Solana and deploying/executing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. Refer to the `[documentation](docs/ramm)` for detailed information on available methods and their usage.
